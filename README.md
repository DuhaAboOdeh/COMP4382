# COMP4382
Welcome to COMP4382 repository 
The instructor will use this repository to upload required software, sample code, etc.  

The list of required software for the course:
1. The Netbeans IDE 8.1. You can download and install the version that comes with JDK 8 or install JDK in a standalone fashion. (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html)
Netbeans comes with SOA modules (for creation and deployment of Web services).
2. The JAXP Java XML parsing API (https://jaxp.java.net). You can download the latest release 1.6.
3. Netbeans comes with Glassfish server by default, but you can configure it with other servers. For example Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org). You can download apache tomcat as a zipped folder and extrat it. Then you can configure netbeans to use it from that folder.
